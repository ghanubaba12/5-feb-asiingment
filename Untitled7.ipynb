    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the practice of hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object, making it easier to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the process of wrapping data and functions within an object to protect them from outside interference and misuse.\n",
